## Lecture 1:  Introduction to Software Engineering

- **software engineering:** establishment and use of engineering principles to get software that is reliable and works efficiently; IEEE 610.12 calls it 'application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software'

- these definitions are good, but they don't say *how* to do software engineering, so people understand software engineering differently

- SE often compared to civil engineering; in both,

  - size matters
  - team effort w/ planning
  - tough to change designs 

- civil engineering different b/c:

  - software can't leverage components
  - physics guides civil engineering

- software has axes of variability:

  - size
  - interaction / how people interact with it
  - requirements / stability or knowledge
  - reliability / need for it
  - security / need for it
  - portability
  - cost

  | **size**            | large                 | large         | moderate              |
  | **interactiveness** | high                  | low           | high                  |
  | **requirements**    | frequent new features | stable        | frequent new features |
  | **reliability**     | moderate              | very high     | moderate              |
  | **security**        | low                   | low           | high                  |
  | **portability**     | high                  | low           | low                   |
  | **cost**            | high                  | high          | low                   |
